My name is <a href="http://alexmanrique.com">Alex Manrique</a> and I'm a software developer with 10+ years of experience in the industry. I'm specialized in backend development specially with the Java programming language but I have done things also in PHP, Scala and now I'm learning Python too. I'm interested in all the stages of software development process from the conception of the idea until the release and the monitoring in production of the software solution.
