<a href="https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot">Spring boot</a> is a Java framework to build backend Java applications. I decided to write this blog post because I saw <a href="https://github.com/alexmanrique/spring-boot-application-example/network/members">7 forks</a> in my Github repository where I wrote a spring boot helloworld application some time ago and I thought could be interesting to share.

Where is the repository
-----------------------------------
Here's the link to the Github repository : <a href="https://github.com/alexmanrique/spring-boot-application-example">https://github.com/alexmanrique/spring-boot-application-example</a>

If you want to try it you just need to clone the repository in your local environment using:

```java
git clone https://github.com/alexmanrique/spring-boot-application-example.git
```

Prerequisites
---------------------------
To run the app you need to have <a href="https://maven.apache.org/">Maven</a> installed in your local environment to be able to download all the dependencies of the project. You need to have also installed <a href="https://www.oracle.com/sa/java/technologies/javase/javase-jdk8-downloads.html">Java 8 JDK</a>.  

Once you have cloned the repository you can open the repository in Intellij IDEA or your favorite IDE.

How to start the app
----------------------------
If you go to the class <a href="https://github.com/alexmanrique/spring-boot-application-example/blob/master/src/main/java/com/myapp/MyappServer.java">MyappServer.java</a> then you can run the spring boot application, as simple as that.

{: refdef}

If everything is right you will see the Spring logo in console 

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
![dist files]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/spring-boot-started.png)
{: refdef}

And a message that the application is up and running:

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
![dist files]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/spring-boot-started-ok.png)
{: refdef}

Swagger UI
-------------------------
The app uses <a href="https://swagger.io/">Swagger</a> to display useful documentation of the different endpoints and it's easier to start playing doing calls to the API.

Postman calls
-------------------------

If you prefer to use <a href="https://www.postman.com/">Postman</a> I share with you a <a href="https://www.postman.com/collection/">Postman collection</a> to test the Spring boot api that we have just started:

<a href="https://www.getpostman.com/collections/6e45d359bad60ea7b588">https://www.getpostman.com/collections/6e45d359bad60ea7b588</a>

Here we can see a call to get all the cars that we have in the API.


{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
![dist files]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/postman-call.png)

Here you can see a call to find all drivers that are with status `ONLINE`

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
![dist files]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/postman-call-select.png)
{: refdef}

You can use the calls that are in Swagger page and add them to the Postman collection.

Conclusion
------------------------
In this post, we have seen how to start a Spring boot application and how to do some calls using Swagger and Postman.
