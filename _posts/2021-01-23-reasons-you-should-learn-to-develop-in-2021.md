In this post, I will share my thoughts about why you should learn software development in 2021.

1 - You can work from anywhere in the world.
--------------------------------------------------------
It is one of the great advantages that allow you to work in this sector. By not depending on a specific location since you only need a computer and an internet connection, you can live in a location and work for a company or a client that is far from where you are working.

2 - The demand for professionals is higher than the supply.
-----------------------------------------------------------
In all countries, there is a high demand for this type of professionals. The digital transformation is a fact and with the pandemic, this change of model that had already begun before has accelerated.

The trend is increasingly to buy online without physically going to a store, which is why the creation of web platforms that meet these needs is on the rise, and therefore professionals who know how to design and implement them are needed.

3 - Better salaries compared to the average.
--------------------------------------------
If we look at the figures for the salaries of developers in the <a href="https://www.careerexplorer.com/careers/software-engineer/salary/">United States</a> or <a href="https://www.payscale.com/research/CH/Job=Software_Engineer/Salary">Switzerland</a>, these are around 100k on average, quite different from the average salaries of their respective countries.

A programmer engineer is not going to get rich but he is going to have a higher salary compared to other professions.

4 - When you program you are creating a product, a digital product.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Programming for the sake of programming makes no sense, it has to be aimed at achieving a goal that will improve or make life easier for users of these platforms or applications.

It is a creative activity in certain aspects because you have to think of ways to solve the problem that no one may have thought of before.

5 - Develop your analytical and problem-solving skills.
-----------------------------------------------------------
In the end, what a developer does is look for a solution to a problem and therefore has to find a good solution to the problem that has arisen. 

It does not have to be the perfect solution, but rather, starting with a good solution, iterating it to polish it in each iteration.

Conclusion
-----------------
In this post, we have seen some reasons why you should learn to develop in this new year 2021.
