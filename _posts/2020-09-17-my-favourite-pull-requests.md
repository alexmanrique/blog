My favorite pull requests are the ones that where you remove code. Removing code means maintaining less code and the less code that you have, the fewer bugs in your codebase. 

The magic of removing code
--------------------------------
When you remove code your <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2020-04-26-increase-coverage-in-your-java-code %}"> code coverage</a> which is the number of lines of code covered by unit tests will increase and that's positive too. I prefer to have good unit tests and good functional tests rather than having really high code coverage.

As I said in a previous post, we are <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2020-09-09-you-are-not-paid-to-code %}"> not paid to code</a> and if we can keep the same functionalities with less code it means that our codebase is simpler with fewer dependencies and simpler to read and comprehend.

Developers don't complain about code deleting because it has a clear purpose and normally developers don't disagree in <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-01-31-the-importance-of-code-reviews %}">code reviews</a> with this, they like it. 

Remove code without removing functionality
---------------------------------------------
Removing code is good if you don't remove functionality, unless you have been asked to do so or that you detect that some functionality is not used. 

To know if something is used or not, using data helps. Imagine that you have a tool that allows you to create different kinds of promo codes. 

You have different kinds of codes and you see in the data storage that only one kind of promo codes is created often. Here you have a good candidate to remove functionality and removing code. 

> Don't be afraid to do that and don't be attached to that piece of code. Just remove it.  

Sources of dead code
---------------------------------------
- Legacy product features: We have talked about this previously. When we detect that some feature is not used we can get rid of it. No matter if this was requested by some product owner guru or some important person in your company. Just remove it.
- Wizard generated UI code: There are tools that allow you to do some starter code. This can be a source of code to be considered to remove. 
- Return values of functions: This is an example of a code that is not used. Return values if are not used by the caller it means that the lines of code that calculate/process this value can be considered to get removed. 

How to remove code
--------------------------------------------
The first thing that you need to do is to create a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branching_(version_control)">branch</a> of the repository that you want to remove code. Quite helpful to do this removal are grey colors in methods or attributes in <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">Intellij</a>. If there's a method that is not used the IDE warns you with this color and encourages you to take some action on that.

There's an option also in Intellij that allows you to inspect your code. You have to go to Analyze > Inspect Code

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
![dist files]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/inspect_code.png)
{: refdef}

With this option, you can find code smells, warnings, potential bugs that you can have in your code and that you should be aware of. Some of them you will have to fix it, some code will be elegible to be removed and some other will be necessary to refactor.

Conclusion
----------------------------
In this post, we have talked about my favorite kind of pull request because, this way we reduce the number of lines of code without decreasing the value of your product/service, we have fewer bugs and we have more time to do other things because the time of maintenance is lower.
