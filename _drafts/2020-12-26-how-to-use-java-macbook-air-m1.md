In this post we are going to see how to use Java in a Macbook M1 with the new Apple processors.

Options to install Java
--------------------------

https://github.com/microsoft/openjdk-aarch64/releases/tag/16-ea%2B10-macos

Add Java to the JAVA_HOME environment variable
-----------------------------------------------------
Content of the file .zhsrc

export JAVA_HOME=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/zulu-8.jdk/Contents/home/jre

Installing Maven
----------------------------
To install maven in your Macbook Air M1

export PATH=/opt/apache-maven-3.6.3/bin:$PATH

new Macbook AIR the spring-boot application starts in using azul jdk 8

Using Android studio in the new Macbook air
-------------------------------------------

When you install Android Studio you will get the following warning: 

```java
Unable to install Intel® HAXM
Your CPU does not support VT-x.
Unfortunately, your computer does not support hardware accelerated virtualization.
Here are some of your options:
 1) Use a physical device for testing
 2) Develop on a Windows/OSX computer with an Intel processor that supports VT-x and NX
 3) Develop on a Linux computer that supports VT-x or SVM
 4) Use an Android Virtual Device based on an ARM system image
   (This is 10x slower than hardware accelerated virtualization)
Creating Android virtual device
Android virtual device Pixel_3a_API_30_x86 was successfully created
```

Don't panic the only thing that you have to do is to download the last available emulator for apple silicon processors from github https://github.com/741g/android-emulator-m1-preview/releases/tag/0.2.

Once you have downloaded you have to right click to the .dmg file and click open to skip the developer verification.

After opening it you will see `Virtual emulator` in Android studio available to use to deploy your android application. Make sure to have the developer tools available. More details about this emulator you can check out the following <a href="https://androidstudio.googleblog.com/2020/12/android-emulator-apple-silicon-preview.html"> link</a>

Conclusion

In this post we have seen how to use Java in a new Macbook air M1 and how the new processors of Apple outperform the old intel ones that I was using in other computers.
