In this post we are going to talk about the new features in Java 14 (Java SE 14) and its open source Java Development kit (JDK 14) that was released on March 17 , yes during the covid-19 lockdown, and how we take advantage of it to develop. 

Detailed message in NullPointerExceptions
--------------------------------------------

This option by default is disabled, to active it we need to use `-XX:+ShowCodeDetailsInExceptionMessages`. This can be really useful because when encountering a null pointer, the JVM analyses then program to determine which reference was `null`and provide more details in the `NullPointerException.getMessage()`. Also the method, filename and line number are returned. 

Conclusion
