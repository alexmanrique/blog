Labeling

tactical empaty

One crucial aspect of any negotiation is to figure out how your adversary arrived at this position.

Try to look for the real motivations that the other part wants.

Look for No answers rather than easy yes.

Look for that's right, is the better response that you can get.

In salary negotiations don't be the first to talk

You can use a range 

Contrary to popular opinion, listining is not a passive activity. It's the most active thing you can do. 


Chapter 2
-----------------
- A good negotiatior aims to user her skills to reveal the surprises she is certain to find.
- Don't commit to assumptions, view them as hypotheses and use negotiation to test them rigorously.
- Negotiation is not an act of battle, it's a process discovery. The goal is to uncover as much information as possible.
- The goal is to uncover as much information as possible. 
- Make your sole and all-encompassing focus the other person and what they have to say. 
- Slow. It. Down. Going too fast is one of the mistakes all negotiatiors are prone to making. If we are too much in a hurry, people can feel as if they are not being heard.
- Put a smile on your face. When people are in a positive frame of mind, they think more quickly and are more likely to collaborate and problem-solve. Positivity creates mental agility in both you and your counterpart.
The positive/playful voice should be your default voice. 
The direct or assertive voice. Use it rarely, it will cause problems and generate pushback.
Mirrors work magic. Repeat the last three words of what someone has just said. We fear what's different and are drawn to what's similar. Mirroring is the art of insinuating similarity, which facilitates bonding.       




Chapter 3
-----------------
Don't feel their pain, label it.

Label your counterpart's fears to diffuse their power. The faster you interrupt action in your counterpart's anygdala, the part of the brain that generates fear, the faster you can generate feelings of safety, well-being, and trust. 

List the worst things that the other party could say about you and say them before the other person can. Performing and acusation audit in advance prepares you to head off negative dynamics before they take root. 

Remember that you are dealing with a person that want to be understood and appreciated. Use labels to reinforce and encourage positive perceptions and dynamics.

Chapter 4 
------------------
Beware yes, master no

Break the habit of attemptim to get people to say "yes". Being pushed for yes makes people defensive.
No is not a failure. In reality often means "Wait" or "I'm not confortable with that". Learn how to hear it calmly. It's not the negotiation, but the beginning.
Saying "No" makes the speaker feel safe, secure and in control, so trigger it. By saying what they don't want, your counterpart defines their space and gains the confidence and confort to listen to you. I.e: Is now a bad time to talk? is always better than "Do you have a few minutes to talk?"
Persuasion it's about the other party convincing themselves that the solution you want is their own idea. Ask them questions that open paths to your goals.
If a business partner is ignoring you, contact them with a clear and consices "No"-oriented question that suggests that you are ready to walk away. "Have you given up this project" works wonders. 

Chapter 5
------------------
Trigger the two words that immediately transform any negotiation.
In hostage negotiations we never tried to get to "yes" as an endpoint. We knew that yes is nothing without "how". That's right often leads to the best outcomes.
