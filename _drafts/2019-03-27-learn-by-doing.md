This is a statement that is used nowadays in the software development industry but this is a concept that can be used in a lot of environments and disciplines. 

How do you learn to play a sport? Sitting in a table and listening to someone who explains to you how to play?  I don't think so. How do you learn photography? How do you learn to play the guitar? 

There are a lot of examples of where you have the same question. How do you learn it? You learn it when you do it. 

Find the opportunity to learn
------------------------------
Back in October 2018, I wanted to create an Android application of an idea that came to my mind. I wanted to do a kind of mortgage calculator where users could calculate monthly payments using different inputs like location, interest rate, and savings. 

> If you are interested to learn something find an excuse to make a project.

I had used some apps to do these calculations and the user interface of them was not really good and I thought it could be improved introducing some new features that the other existing apps didn't have.

I didn't know how to create an Android application from scratch. Because of my Java development background, I thought It could be easier to do it because android apps use Java - Kotlin is increasing in popularity - rather and ios application that uses Swift as a  programming language. 

Learning android development
--------------------------
Instead of reading all <a href="https://developer.android.com/guide"> android documentation</a> I downloaded <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio">Android Studio</a> 
and I created a new Android project. To accelerate the learning I bought and <a href="https://www.udemy.com/programacion-de-android-desde-cero/">Udemy Android development course</a> where a teacher explained the most important aspects, to begin with. 

I search for things in stackoverflow when I got stuck or I had some doubts such as "How to do a tab layout in Android" or "How to create a Navigation Drawer" where it explained how to do it. 

Another way to accelerate the process was asking a friend of mine who is proficient in Android development - thanks <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cesards/">Cesar</a> - some questions like how to display a table with a lot of rows in a Fragment, or how you can share state between different Fragments of your application. That saved to me some time while building the application.

And the classic way was to search in the documentation about that specific topic. I read it and I apply it back to the code. 

The balance between theory and practice
----------------
It's true that no knowledge is not the best way to start something. You have to know the rules and the basics of what you want to accomplish. 

> You need to know the basics, but you don't need to be a master in the field to create something.

Imagine a doctor with no knowledge that has to do a surgery to someone or a mechanic that has to fix a car. You have to understand the basics of what you have to do to give value to others and then improve while you practice it. In my case, I knew how to develop software but I didn't know how the Android ecosystem worked. 

For sure I have to learn more Android to be able to say that I'm proficient in this technology, however, I know the basics to build up an app that can be useful to people, and built it with a minimum quality to create a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product">Minimum value product</a> (MVP). 

Start a project
----------------
The best way to learn is to start something related to your field of interest. It's important to commit to this because if you give up really easily you will end up learning nothing and you will reduce your motivation and your self-stem. 

Think about something that can be helpful to people and start to create it.  <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/30296-inspiration-exists-but-it-has-to-find-you-working"> Inspiration will find you working</a> said Pablo Picasso. And it's true because while 
I was doing de Android app I thought about other features that can be useful.

Make mistakes to learn
-------------------------
Every time that I did a mistake while I was developing I learned which was the way to do it well, or at least better than the previous time - continuous improvement - When I run the Android emulator with my apk I was able to see what were the mistakes that I had done, I went back to the editor and I fixed them.
