I write this post to share how to backup your files into western digital NAS drive.

I was thinking to backup my files, it's a good practice to have redundancy of your data. The same way that you don't have a single server to handle all the traffic and you have more than one just in case that one of them is not available, the same happens with data. You cannot have a single point of failure (SOF)
