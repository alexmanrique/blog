This post will be a little bit different cause I will add the commands that I used to get Jekyll running on my Macbook Air m1.

## Trying to run Jekyll using ARM
 

The first thing I did was trying to install a Ruby version that is compatible with ARM and to achieve this I installed `rbenv` to be able to pick a recent version easily.

```console
$ brew install rbenv
```

To verify that rbenv is set up properly, I used the `type` command, which displays more information about the rbenv command:

```console
$ type rbenv
```

Then with the next command I init the `rbenv` environment.

```console
$ rbenv init
```

```console
$ eval "$(rbenv init -)"
```

After running the previous command I added this `eval` into my `.zshrc` file. I added it using `vi` command. This way I don't have to run this command every time I open a terminal.

```console
$ cd 
$ vi .zshrc   
```

With the following commands, I installed a version that is compatible with arm64 (Apple silicon)

```console
$ rbenv install 2.7.2
```

```console
$ rbenv global 2.7.2
```

Running the following command we can see that the installed version of Ruby is an arm64 version. 

```console
$ ruby -v
ruby 2.7.2p137 (2020-10-01 revision 5445e04352) [arm64-darwin20]
```

Then after installing the Ruby version, I tried to run `bundle install` into the directory that I have this blog Jekyll application, but the results were not the ones I expected.  

```console
$ arch -x86_64 bundle install

Error: Cannot install under Rosetta 2 in ARM default prefix (/opt/homebrew)!
To rerun under ARM use:
    arch -arm64 brew install ...
To install under x86_64, install Homebrew into /usr/local.
```

Trying to run the command to start the Jekyll application locally there were some undefined symbols for the arm64 architecture. 

```console
$ bundle exec jekyll serve

Undefined symbols for architecture arm64:
  "_ffi_call", referenced from:
      _ffi_raw_call in raw_api.o
      _ffi_java_raw_call in java_raw_api.o
  "_ffi_closure_trampoline_table_page", referenced from:

      _ffi_prep_raw_closure_loc in raw_api.o
      _ffi_prep_java_raw_closure_loc in java_raw_api.o
ld: symbol(s) not found for architecture arm64

make[3]: *** [libffi.la] Error 1
make[2]: *** [all-recursive] Error 1
make[1]: *** [all] Error 2
make: ***
```

Also, I didn't get lucky when trying to run the following commands.

```console
$ arch -x86_64 bundle update
arch: posix_spawnp: bundle: Bad CPU type in executable
```

```console
$ arch -x86_64 bundle install
arch: posix_spawnp: bundle: Bad CPU type in executable
```

## Running Jekyll using arch x86_64

In the previous section, we have seen how I struggled to try to run Jekyll on my Apple Silicon processor. The good news is that I found a workaround, using the `arch -x86_64` before the command that downloads and executes the `homebrew` installation shellscript.   

```console
$ arch -x86_64 /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```
> All the following commands where executed in the root folder of my jekyll project on my laptop

Then I installed the <a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/bundler">bundler</a> and <a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/jekyll">jekyll</a> gems using the following command:

```console
$ arch -x86_64 gem install --user-install bundler jekyll
Successfully installed bundler-2.2.8
Parsing documentation for bundler-2.2.8
Done installing documentation for bundler after 1 seconds
Successfully installed jekyll-4.2.0
Parsing documentation for jekyll-4.2.0
Installing ri documentation for jekyll-4.2.0
Done installing documentation for jekyll after 0 seconds
2 gems installed
```
The next step was to execute the `bundle update` command:
```console
$ bundle update

Post-install message from sass:

Ruby Sass has reached end-of-life and should no longer be used.

* If you use Sass as a command-line tool, we recommend using Dart Sass, the new
  primary implementation: https://sass-lang.com/install

* If you use Sass as a plug-in for a Ruby web framework, we recommend using the
  sassc gem: https://github.com/sass/sassc-ruby#readme

The next command to execute was `bundle install` to install all of the required gems from this blog on my local laptop:

```console
$ bundle install

## Up and running

Now when I execute the bundle command to run Jekyll in my local I got it up and running!

```console
$ bundle exec jekyll serve --drafts

## Conclusion

In this post, we have seen the process that I followed to have running Jekyll on my Macbook Air m1. I hope that this post can help you getting it up and running faster than I did and not having to look for on the internet for responses to my problem a whole afternoon.
