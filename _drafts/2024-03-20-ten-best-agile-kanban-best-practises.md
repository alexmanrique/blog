I have worked using kanban methodology for the last 8 years and I want to share 10 bullet points regarding this methodology.

1 - Limit the work in progress
-----------------------------
This first point is related with focus. Having a lot of open topics, tasks promotes task switching and this makes that the quality of the work decrease. We need to promote a system that makes that people in the team can focus on one single task. Do one thing at a time. 

2 - Stop starting, start finishing.
---------------------------------
This principle is important because we don't get the benefit of hours of work until we deliver the task. We need to remember this principle. 

3 - Measure customer lead time.
------------------------------------------------
The things that don't get measured cannot be improved. We don't want that the time to deliver tasks increases and we got problems.

4 - All types of work has to be visualized.
------------------------------------------
Every task that consumes time from the team needs to be visualized in a digital board. This way we can prioritize them, and also decide before doing it if we need to do it or not according to the impact that this task has.
Have impact of everything before starting to be able to prioritize the most impactful tasks.

5 - Do retrospectives.
-----------------------
Look back and see what has been done and what can be improved. It's a moment to sit, think what was great about the past, and what can be improved. However without actions nothing changes and if there are things that need to improve as a team there must be some action that lead to that improvement.

6 - Validate hypothesis cheaply
--------------------------------
We want to build things that meet the minimum effort that meets our customer expectations. We don't want to create something for a long time that nobody is interested in using. It's a waste of time that you could have used to do something else more impactful. 

7 - Continous delivery
-------------------------
You need to make it easy to deliver things to production. Developers should merge code in the module repository and create the realease easily. 

8 - Daily meeting to check blockers
----------------------------------
The daily meeting is a good moment to talk about the different tasks, their progress and to check if there's any blocker that should be raised. During this meeting we look the board from right to left, starting we the tickets that need less time to deliver to production.  

9 - Ask why before starting a new task
----------------------------------
Doing things without stoping and thinking why we are doing something or which is the benefit that will give to the team that task it's important because we don't want to waste time on things that don't provide value.  


Conclusion
